# Neural-Net-Using-NumPy
This repository contains Python code for training a neural network and visualizing its performance metrics without a high level API. The project provides a comprehensive toolkit for conducting gradient descent optimization, tracking training progress, and plotting the evolution of weights and biases over time - no Pytorch or TensorFlow, just NumPy!
