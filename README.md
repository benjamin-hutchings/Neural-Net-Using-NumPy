# Neural Network Training and Visualization without TensorFlow or Pytorch!

## Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for training a neural network and visualizing its performance metrics. The project provides a toolkit for conducting gradient descent optimization, tracking training progress, and plotting the evolution of weights and biases over time. No Keras, no PyTorch, no TensorFlow - just NumPy!

## Features

- **Neural Network Training**: Implements gradient descent to optimize weights and biases.
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs accuracy and loss at regular intervals.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plots training metrics, weights, and biases over iterations.
- **Prediction and Testing**: Generates predictions and visualizes results for individual samples.

## Requirements

- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook in Colab**:
    - [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/neural-network-training/blob/master/your-notebook-name.ipynb)
    - You'll be prompted to upload your Kaggle API token to your Colab environment to download the MINST dataset for this demo.
    - This token can be downloaded from your Kaggle account settings (Account tab, under the API section, you can create a new API token).

2. **Train the Neural Network**:
    - Follow the steps in the notebook to train the model using your data.

3. **Plot Training Metrics**:
    - Use the provided code cells to plot accuracy and loss.

4. **Plot Weights and Biases**:
    - Visualize the evolution of weights and biases over the training iterations.

5. **Evaluate and Test Predictions**:
    - Generate predictions and visualize them using the provided code cells.
